// In verilog the casez and casex are used to treat masked bits z and x as don't cares respectively. 
// SV allows mask bits to be used in the case items. The donâ€™t care bits are specified, using X, Z or ?, as with casex.
// The wildcard character "?" in a case pattern signifies that any value (0, 1, X, or Z) in that specific bit position is acceptable for a match.
